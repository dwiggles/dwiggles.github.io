# What's going on at fast.ai?

## Working through fast.ai

I'm gonna be a "student" here for the next few weeks (months?), starting now... and the first thing I notice is a fresh post from Prof Jeremy Howard that suggests that his students (that's me!) should blog. Okay. Gonna do that, too.

{% include alert.html text="I'm gonna be a student and treat fast.ai like the course that it is." %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="Blogging might help me stay accounable to this committment" %}

Great idea, Prof. Jeremy. Thanks!
